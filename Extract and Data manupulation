Aggregating finances
In this exercise you would like to learn more about the differences in payments between the customers who are active and those who are not.

Find out the differences in their total number of payments by COUNT()ing the payment_id.
Find out the differences in their average payments by using AVG().
Find out the differences in their total payments by using SUM().
Ensure the aggregate functions GROUP BY whether customer payments are active.

Ans: 
SELECT active, 
       COUNT(payment_id) AS num_transactions, 
       AVG(amount) AS avg_amount, 
       SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM payment AS p
INNER JOIN customer AS c
  ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY active;


Aggregating strings
You are planning to update your storefront window to demonstrate how family-friendly and multi-lingual your DVD collection is. To prepare for this you need to prepare a comma-separated list G-rated film titles
by language released in 2010.

Instructions
Return a column with a list of comma-separated film titles by using the STRING_AGG() function.
Limit the results to films that have a release_year of 2010 AND have a rating of 'G'.
Ensure that the operation is grouped by the language name.

Ans -- 

SELECT name, 
	STRING_AGG(title, ',') AS film_titles
FROM film AS f
INNER JOIN language AS l
  ON f.language_id = l.language_id
WHERE release_year = 2010
  AND rating = 'G'
GROUP BY name;
