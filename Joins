INNER JOIN Steps 

SELECT title, length 
FROM film AS f
INNER JOIN Catagory AS c
  ON f.film_id = c.catagory_id 
WHERE c.catagory = 'Documentory'
  AND f.rating IN ('G' 'PG')
ORDER BY length DESC;


Explain: 
1. Select the two tables, and build their Alias. 
2. Find the colums 
3. Use ON command for the merge 
4. Use the table key for the logic of join, here the film_id 
5. WHERE command is used for filtering the results 
6. Use the condition to support the WHERE command 
7. For additional conditions use AND 
8. IN command is used to filter the results
9. ORDER by <column name>



Practice the essentials
In this exercise you are preparing list of your top paying active customers. The data you will need are the names of the customer sorted by the amount they paid.
Return the first_name, last_name and amount.
INNER JOIN the tables you need for this query: payment and customer using the customer_id for the join.
Ensure only active customers are returned.
Sort the results in DESCending order by the amount paid.
