SELECT title, length 
FROM film AS f
INNER JOIN Catagory AS c
  ON f.film_id = c.catagory_id 
WHERE c.catagory = 'Documentory'
  AND f.rating IN ('G' 'PG')
ORDER BY length DESC;

2. Find the colums 
3. Use ON command for the merge 
4. Use the table key for the logic of join, here the film_id 
5. WHERE command is used for filtering the results 
6. Use the condition to support the WHERE command 
7. For additional conditions use AND 
8. IN command is used to filter the results
9. ORDER by <column name>
